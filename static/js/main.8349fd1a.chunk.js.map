It was a tough tough tough marathon under rainy, windy, and cold conditions! I struggled really hard, but kept pushing until the finish line recording a 4-hour running time.</p>\n            \n            <h3>Study abroad reunion <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"emoji\">üá®üáø</span></h3>\n            <p>My Hong Kong exchange friends and I recently met up in Prague, Czech Republic for our 5th consecutive study abroad reunion. Previous meetups were: New York '15, San Francisco '16, Barcelona '17, and New York '18.</p>\n\n            <h3>New habits <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"emoji\">üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</span></h3>\n            <p>I‚Äôve doubled down on long-term habits and continued many new habits I started last year: daily meditations, yoga, readings, journaling, and trying to sleep 8 hours. However, I'll add some new ones going forward: no alcohol, reduce the amount of protein in my daily meals, and reduce sugar and coffee intake.</p>\n\n            <h3>Writings <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"emoji\">üìù</span></h3>\n            <p>I often write <em>raw thoughts</em> here ‚Äì it's my scratchpad: <a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://notyourtypicalasian.com\" target=\"_blank\">https://notyourtypicalasian.com</a></p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"now_section reads\">\n            <div className=\"now_section_reads\">\n                <h3>Currently reading <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"emoji\">üìö</span></h3>\n                <ul>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/2PBamaQ\" target=\"_blank\">Homo Deus</a></li>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/2SdahMd\" target=\"_blank\">Upheaval</a></li>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/2S56D6U\" target=\"_blank\">Cien A√±os de Soledad</a></li>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/35NAqEY\" target=\"_blank\">Medidations</a></li>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/2S6LVne\" target=\"_blank\">From Ramen to Riches</a></li>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/2EyGaqo\" target=\"_blank\">My Turn: A Life of Total Football</a></li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"now_section_reads\">\n                <h3>Completed <span role=\"img\" aria-label=\"emoji\">üìö</span></h3>\n                <ul>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/38VGHAv\" target=\"_blank\">The Courage to be Disliked</a></li>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/35BaiNR\" target=\"_blank\">Anything You Want</a></li>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/2rS77CO\" target=\"_blank\">Sapiens</a></li>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://basecamp.com/shapeup\" target=\"_blank\">Shape Up</a></li>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/35AiCgx\" target=\"_blank\">Daily Stoics</a></li>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/38RNtHF\" target=\"_blank\">Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</a></li>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/34DNsng\" target=\"_blank\">Rich People Problems</a></li>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/2S63VxZ\" target=\"_blank\">Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike</a></li>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/34CNqfg\" target=\"_blank\">The Manual: A Philosopher's Guide to Life</a></li>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/38UjpLm\" target=\"_blank\">Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less</a></li>\n                    <li><a rel='noreferrer noopener' href=\"https://amzn.to/35BM9GH\" target=\"_blank\">Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life</a></li>\n                </ul>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"now_section\">\n            <p><em>This page was updated Dec 18, 2019.
